    blog1 : "I have created a prototype of a webshop application, complete with both frontend and backend functionalities. The application is now available online for demonstration purposes. Its main features include the Landing Page, where users can browse and order products. Additionally, the Admin interface allows for various actions, such as listing orders, updating their status, adding new products, deactivating or deleting existing products, and modifying their components. The webshop prototype aims to provide a realistic shopping experience and showcase the functionalities and system I have developed. I have put a strong emphasis on intuitive user interface and seamless navigation, ensuring that customers can easily browse and place orders. This webshop prototype is the result of my efforts, and I am excited to share this project with the community. I hope that the demonstration of the application will be inspiring and engaging for those interested in web development and e-commerce. Stay tuned for more updates, as I will soon provide detailed demonstrations and share further projects!",
